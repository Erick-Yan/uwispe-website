                                As Canada's first student chapter,
                                we are invested in inspiring and cultivating the next generation of students looking to change
                                the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. We are a branch under the International Society for
                                Pharmaceutical Engineering, an organization that is committed to the educational and technical
                                advancement of its members while striving to provide solutions towards complex pharmaceutical
                                industry challenges. We hope to create unique experiences for Waterloo students that will expose them
                                to the essential knowledge and ideas that can push them towards success.
                                In an industry that's often perceived to be outdated in its practices,
                                we are looking to change that view through modern big data, machine learning, and equipment/facility
                                design applications.
